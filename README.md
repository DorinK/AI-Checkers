Second Assignment in 'Artificial Intelligence' course by Dr. Ram Meshulam at Bar-Ilan University.

In this task we designed and implemented players for the game **𝐶ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑠**.  
The rules of the game required for the exercise can be found here: https://www.itsyourturn.com/t_helptopic2030.html.

The players we have implemented, given a board mode, will return the action to execution. The selection of the operation will be done using different variations to the algorithm **𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥** with **prunning 𝛼𝛽**.

<ins>Exercise objectives:</ins>  
* Build a player for a two-player game.
* Experiencing in the analysis and construction of heuristic functions.
* Experimenting with the 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥 algorithm and implementing variations on it
* Conducting research comparing the performance of different players.
